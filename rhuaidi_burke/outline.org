* The Plan

1. Gauss-Bonnet and \poincare-Hopf in two dimensions
   - In particular, we obtain the two-dimensional Hairy Ball theorem

2. \poincare-Hopf and Euler characteristic to show that
   - odd-dimensional manifolds have a non-vanishing vector field
   - non-vanishing Euler characteristic implies all vector fields have a zero

3. de Rham cohomology to compute Euler characteristic \(\chi\)
   - \(\sphere^{2n}\) has \(\chi = 2\)
   - hence the Hairy-ball theorem follws

4. "number" structure on the complex numbers, quaternions and octonions
   - Show that \(\sphere^1, \sphere^3, \sphere^7\) have trivial tangent bundles

5. Related "number" structure and Hopf fibration

6. Discuss Adams' results that in particular show all other odd dimensional spheres do not have trivial tangent bundle
